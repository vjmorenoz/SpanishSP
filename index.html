                <h2>What is Spanish Starter Pack?</h2>
                <p>
                    Spanish Starter Pack is a project that was born from the desire to create useful tools for my students, to share my grammar knowledge and to provide really useful examples for a person who is learning the language. The main goal of Spanish Starter Pack is to help mainly those students who need a lot of theory and texts to be able to understand what they are studying, not only to know how to use it but the reasons behind each word and sentence.

                <h2>Why is learning Spanish so challenging?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Spanish has a lot of grammar rules, vocabulary, and cultural details that make it both complex and interesting. Learning it can be challenging for many reasons:
                    <br><br>
                    - <strong>Language barriers</strong>: Many Spanish-speaking countries have high levels of language barriers, making it difficult for people to communicate with each other and with native speakers.
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Time and effort</strong>: Learning Spanish takes time and effort, which can be a significant commitment.
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Confusion and misunderstanding</strong>: Spanish is not always easy to understand and can lead to confusion and misunderstanding.
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Overwhelm</strong>: Spanish is a vast language with many words and grammar rules. It can be overwhelming to learn and remember all of it.

            <h2>Lesson 1: Basic introduction to Spanish</h2>
            <p>
              Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages, with over 500
              million native speakers! It comes from Latin and is part of the
              Romance language family, along with French, Italian, and
              Portuguese. Spanish is phonetic, meaning words are pronounced as
              they’re written, but watch out—small pronunciation mistakes can
              lead to hilarious misunderstandings! In this lesson, you’ll learn
              what makes Spanish unique, from its alphabet to its verb
              conjugations. Ready to dive in? ¡Vamos!

            <h2>Lesson 2: Conjugations</h2>
            <p>
              Spanish verbs change their endings based on who's doing the action
              and when it's happening, this is called conjugation. There are
              three main verb types: -ar, -er, and -ir, each with their own
              patterns. In the present tense, regular verbs follow predictable
              rules, so once you learn the endings, you can start forming real
              sentences. Don't worry about irregulars yet, we'll get to them
              later. For now, get comfy with the basics and watch your Spanish
              take shape!

            <h2>Lesson 3: The Basic Structure of Sentences</h2>
            <p>
              Spanish usually follows a subject-verb-object order, but it’s
              flexible! You can often drop the subject if the verb makes it
              clear who’s acting (thanks, conjugation!). Questions flip the
              usual order or add words like dónde, and always need opening and
              closing question marks (¿?). Exclamations can shift the word order
              or add emotional words like qué or cómo, and must include both ¡
              and !. Mastering these patterns helps you sound more natural and
              expressive in Spanish!

            <h2>Lesson 4: Spanish Pronunciation</h2>
            <p>
              Spanish pronunciation is refreshingly consistent, words are
              pronounced just as they're written! In this lesson, you'll
              discover how Spanish vowels always keep the same sound, how to
              handle the famous “ñ” and other tricky letters, and why word
              stress matters. You'll also learn to avoid funny mistakes like
              mixing up “papa” and “papá.” Mastering these basics will help you
              sound more natural and confident when speaking Spanish!

            <h2>Lesson 16: Imperfect past vs Simple past</h2>
            <p>
              Spanish has two main ways to talk about the past: the preterite
              and the imperfect. The preterite is for actions that are finished,
              like a one-time event. The imperfect is for things that used to
              happen or were happening, like background stories or habits. It’s
              all about how you view the action: complete or ongoing. Watch for
              clues like ayer (preterite) or cuando era niño (imperfect).
              Mastering this difference will make your stories flow naturally!

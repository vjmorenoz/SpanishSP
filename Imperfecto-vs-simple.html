                <h2>Preterite vs. Imperfect:</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    Spanish has two primary past tenses: the preterite and the imperfect. These tenses are essential for communicating events, narrating stories, and describing past situations. However, they serve distinct purposes and are not interchangeable. Understanding the difference between them requires analyzing how each one represents the aspect of an action—whether it is viewed as completed or ongoing.
                    <br><br>
                    The <strong>preterite</strong> is used when an action in the past is seen as completed. This means the event had a defined beginning and end, even if that timeframe isn't explicitly stated. In contrast, the <strong>imperfect</strong> is used for actions that were ongoing or habitual in the past. Instead of seeing them as completed events, we focus on their duration, repetition, or background role in a narrative.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding when to use each tense requires paying attention to time markers, context, and whether an action is seen as a whole event or as part of a larger situation.

                        <li>
                            Preterite: Ayer estudié español.

                <h2>Key Differences</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    The choice between the preterite and imperfect depends on how the speaker views the action. Here are some key distinctions:
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Preterite:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used for actions that happened at a specific time.</li>
                        <li>Indicates a completed action.</li>
                        <li>Often includes time expressions like ayer, anoche, el año pasado.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Imperfect:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Describes repeated or habitual actions in the past.</li>
                        <li>Sets the scene or provides background information.</li>
                        <li>Often includes time expressions like siempre, cuando era niño, todos los días.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Why do they look so similar</h2>

                <p class="article-lesson">
                    The preterite and imperfect tenses are often confused due to their similarities. They both involve describing actions in the past, but they serve different purposes. The preterite is used for completed events with a clear timeframe, while the imperfect describes ongoing or habitual past actions.
                    <br><br>
                    To help distinguish between them, look for key time markers, context, and whether an action is seen as a whole event or as part of a larger situation. For example, the preterite often includes time expressions like <strong>ayer, anoche, el año pasado</strong>, while the imperfect often includes time expressions like <strong>siempre, cuando era niño, todos los días.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="example"><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Preterite: El concierto empezó a las 8.  
                            <small><i>The concert started at 8.</i></small>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Imperfect: Había mucha gente en el concierto.  
                            <small><i>There were a lot of people at the concert.</i></small>
                        </li>

                <p class="article-lesson">
                    When to use the preterite and imperfect can vary depending on the context and the speaker's intent. Here are some examples:
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Preterite:</strong>
                    <ul>

                <h2>The Difference Between "Fui" and "Iba" in Spanish</h2>
            
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    The choice between the preterite ("fui") and the imperfect ("iba") in Spanish significantly alters the meaning of a sentence because these verb tenses express different aspects of an action. To fully grasp this distinction, it is essential to analyze the concepts of verbal aspect, event completion, and temporal reference
                </p>

                <p class="example"><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fui a la playa ayer.  
                            <small><i>I went to the beach yesterday.</i></small>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iba a la playa ayer.  
                            <small><i>I was going to the beach yesterday.</i></small>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="example"><strong>Explanation:</strong>
                    In both sentences, "fui a la playa ayer" and "iba a la playa ayer" have the same meaning, but they use different verb tenses. The preterite ("fui") indicates that the action happened at a specific time, while the imperfect ("iba") indicates that the action is ongoing or habitual.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In summary, the preterite ("fui") is used for completed events with a clear timeframe, while the imperfect ("iba") describes ongoing or habitual past actions. To learn this distinction, it is essential to analyze the concepts of verbal aspect, event completion, and temporal reference.

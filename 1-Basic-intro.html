                <h1>What is Spanish? A Clear and Simple Guide</h1>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    Spanish is a language‚Äîjust like English, French, or Japanese. People use it to talk, write, and communicate with each other. It is one of the most spoken languages in the world, with more than 500 million native speakers across different countries.
                    <br><br>
                    Spanish has <strong>A LOT</strong> of verb tenses and conjugations, and you'll learn more about them throughout this course, but first there are a couple of things you need to know before you start going there.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>1. Spanish is a Romance Language</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    Spanish comes from Latin, the language spoken by the ancient Romans. It belongs to a group of languages called Romance languages, which also includes:
                    <br><br>
                    ‚úÖ Italian <br>
                    ‚úÖ French <br>
                    ‚úÖ Portuguese <br>
                    ‚úÖ Romanian <br>
                    ‚úÖ Catalan <br>
                    ‚úÖ And many more! <br><br>
                    
                    This means that if you know one of these languages, you might recognize some words in Spanish!
                </p>
                <div class="example">
                    <ul>
                        <li>English: "Animal" ‚Üí Spanish: "Animal" <small><i>(same spelling, different pronunciation)</i></small></li>
                        <li>English: "Family" ‚Üí Spanish: "Familia"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>2. Spanish uses a simple alphabet</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    Spanish uses the same letters as English (A, B, C, etc.), but with one extra letter: √ë (√±) <small><i>enye</i></small>.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides "√±," the Spanish alphabet is easy to recognize because most letters are pronounced exactly as they are written‚Äîunlike English, where words often sound different from how they look.
                </p>
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Examples for √ë:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ni√±o (child) <small><i>Not nino, sounds more like "Ninyo"</i></small></li>
                        <li>Espa√±a (Spain) <small><i>More like Espanya. Don't say Espana, because "es pana" means "he/she is friendly" in venezuelan slang.</i></small></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Another hilarious example could be the "My dad is 45 years old", in Spanish we would say "Mi pap√° tiene 45 a√±os"
                        <br><br>
                        But, what if you mispronounce <strong>"paP√Å"</strong> as <strong>"PApa"</strong> and <strong>"a√±os"</strong> as <strong>"anos"</strong>? Like: <i>"Mi papa tiene 45 anos"</i>
                        <br><br>
                        In this case, you would be saying: "My potato has 45 buttholes" which is too much for a poor potato.
                        <br><br>
                        There are many other tricky letters in Spanish, but for now, just remember that most Spanish words sound the same when you pronounce them. We'll talk about the others later.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>3. Spanish is a Phonetic Language</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    Spanish is considered a <strong>phonetic language</strong>, which means that words are pronounced exactly as they are written. Once you learn the sound of each letter, you'll be able to read and pronounce any word correctly‚Äîsomething that isn't always true in English! In contrast, English has many silent letters and unpredictable pronunciation rules (like ‚Äúknife‚Äù or ‚Äúthrough‚Äù), while Spanish follows consistent patterns. As a native Spanish speaker who learned English years ago, I could tell you that sometimes when I see a new word in English, it's <strong>IMPOSSIBLE</strong> for me to guess what's the correct pronunciation.
                    <br><br>
                    This makes Spanish pronunciation easier to master compared to English, as long as you remember the basic sounds of each letter.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Examples:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>‚úÖ Casa (house) ‚Üí Pronounced KAH-sah <small><i>(just as it looks)</i></small></li>
                            <li>‚úÖ Gato (cat) ‚Üí Pronounced GAH-toh <small><i>(no silent letters or surprises!)</i></small></li>
                            <li>‚úÖ Amigo (friend) ‚Üí Pronounced ah-MEE-goh <small><i>(each vowel keeps its own sound)</i></small></li>

                <h2>4. Spanish Nouns Have Gender</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    One of the first things you'll notice when learning Spanish is that every noun has a gender, it is either masculine or feminine and, in some cases both! This doesn't mean objects literally have a gender; it's just a grammatical rule that affects how words are used in sentences.
                </p>
                <h3>üîπ How can you tell if a noun is masculine or feminine?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚úÖ <strong>Most</strong> words ending in "-o" are masculine.</li>
                        <li>‚û°Ô∏è Ejemplo: gato (cat) ‚Üí masculine <small><i>(Yes! It can be a female cat, but would be gata)</i></small></li>
                        <li>‚úÖ <strong>Most</strong> words ending in "-a" are feminine.</li>
                        <li>‚û°Ô∏è Ejemplo: mesa (table) ‚Üí feminine</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>However, like in any language, there are exceptions! Some words don't follow this pattern (d√≠a is masculine, and mano is feminine), but we'll talk about that later.
                <br><br>
                üí° Why does this matter?
                <br><br>
                The gender of a noun affects the words around it, such as articles (the equivalent of ‚Äúthe‚Äù and ‚Äúa/an‚Äù in English) and adjectives.
                </p>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Examples:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>üîπ "The cat" in Spanish: El gato (masculine)</li>
                        <li>üîπ "The table" in Spanish: La mesa (feminine)</li>
                    </ul>
                    We use <strong>"el"</strong> <small><i>The</i></small> and <strong>"un"</strong> <small><i>a/an</i></small> for masculine words and <strong>"la"</strong> and <strong>"una"</strong> for feminine words. This rule also applies to adjectives: A beautiful cat would be "Un gato hermoso" (masculine), while a beautiful table would be "Una mesa hermosa" (feminine).

                <h2>5. Spanish Verbs Change Depending on Who is Speaking</h2>
                <p class="article-lesson">
                    That's called <strong>conjugation</strong>, is the process of changing the ending of a verb to match the subject, tense, and mood of the sentence.
                </p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p>In English, verbs don't change much. For example, in a present tense you would say:
                        <br><br>
                        ‚úÖ I eat <br>
                        ‚úÖ You eat <br>
                        ‚úÖ We eat  <br><br>
                        But in Spanish, verbs change depending on the subject.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Yo como (I eat)</li>
                            <li>T√∫ comes (You eat)</li>
                            <li>√âl/Ella come (He/She eats)</li>
                            <li>Nosotros comemos (We eat)</li>
                            <li>Ustedes comen (You all eat / You <small><i>plural</i></small> eat)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        This happens with every verb, and it's a very important part of learning Spanish. There are many tenses and moods in Spanish, we'll talk about those later as well but it's really important for you to know about them before you get there.
